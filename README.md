# ATM-Interface-using-TCP-protocol

This is my computer networks project done in Java

Automated Teller Machine(ATM) is implemented in a typical client server model using TCP protocol

It is capable of serving multiple clients using threads and secure and reliable connection using TCP protocol and AES encryption.

It contains totally three files. Loginpage and ATM client file will be the client side modules and BanK server is Server side module.

It is connected with SMTP protocol in the server module so that it will send email after every sucessful transactions.

A SQL database(SQLite3) is connected in the server module to store customer information.

In client module, GUI is given so that customer can interact with the machine.

For secure transfer of data, Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is used to encrypt the data.

Make sure to import all modules and necessary APIs(SMTP, SQLite3) to run the modules sucessfully.
